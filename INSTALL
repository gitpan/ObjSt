** Installation

Written to ObjectStore 5.0 and SunPro 4.0 C++.

The build process is non-standard and needs some hand-holding.  (Sorry!)

0. Type './m check'.  It should output "Looks good.".  If you see an error
like this: "No such file: README", then you may have an incomplete
distribution.

1. Examine the file './m'.  This is the makefile.  Read the instructions
at the top and make any necessary changes.

2. Run the './m' script.

3. It should build an './osperl' binary and run the test scripts.  The
./t/hash.t script fails on two tests.  This problem has been reported to
the perlbug mailing list.
